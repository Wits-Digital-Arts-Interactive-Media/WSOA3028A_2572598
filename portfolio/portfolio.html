                    <p class="post-description">A piece that resonates with me so much. Inspired by George Condo, I wanted to explore cubism and the mix of different colours and shapes. The work depicts a man split between him, trying to find the balance within his insanity. The wings represent him finding inner peace even throughout the chaos that lives in his head.</p>

                    <p class="post-description">First time I have really explored abstract style. This is a commissioned piece I did for my uncle. I had much time exploring during October trying to figure out what to express. October was a difficult month of frustration and self doubt. I thought the name would be fitting considering the dull and hopeless feeling October felt for me. Throughout this dark storm, there is a sense of calmness and peace that remains within.</p>

                    <p class="post-description">This piece is based on the civil unrest that happened in July 2021 in Durban. The man with the crown represents former president Jacob Zuma as “the king” who was recognised as a powerful influential political figure for many of those, however, the people were sold false promises and are still unhappy. This piece represents more than just the conflict of that time. It represents the chaos and destruction that this country has suffered and yet more that is yet to come whilst we are still labelled as the rainbow nation. Nothing very colourful in our lives remains.</p>

                    <p class="post-description">This was a commissioned pieces for a friend of mine who makes music specializing in AfroHouse and AfroTech. He wanted something that resonates with house as a genre and how the sounds express what it means to be African. I spent a lot of time looking at historical African caveman art markings and different patterns of clothing from different South African tribes to understand and try to mix the rhythm of music with art.</p>
