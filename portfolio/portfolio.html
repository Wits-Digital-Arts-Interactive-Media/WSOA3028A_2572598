          <h3>Conversations with Myself (2023)</h3>
          <h4>Acrylic, Spray Paint & Oil Pastel on Fabriano Paper</h4>
          <h4>80cm x 150cm</h4>
          <p>This is a portfolio piece that I did as another experiment of art styles inspired by Jean-Michel  Basquiat and George Condo. It is a portfolio piece that will be exhibited and sold after the exhibition.</p>

          <img src="../portfolio/portfolio-images/Creep.jpg" width="400" height="400"  alt="Creep Painting">
          <h3>CREEP (2024)</h3>
          <h4>Acrylic & Oil Paint on Canvas</h4>
          <h4>40cm x 40cm</h4>
          <p>This is a portfolio piece that I plan exhibit one day. This piece is inspired by a combination of my favourite modern artists whilst exploring exaggerated aniamtion and cartoon styles and features.</p>
        <div class="block">
          <img src="../portfolio/portfolio-images/Find Your Wings.jpg" width="450" height="500" alt="Cubism and Abstract Painting">
          <h3> FIND YOUR WINGS (2022)</h3>
          <h4>Acrylic & Oil Paint on Canvas</h4>
          <h4>45cm x 60cm</h4>
          <p>A piece that resonates with me so much. Inspired by George Condo, I wanted to explore cubism and the mix of different colours and shapes. The work depicts a man split between him, trying to find the balance within his insanity. The wings represent him finding inner peace even throughout the chaos that lives in his head.</p>

          <h3>Grey October(2022)</h3>
          <h4>Acrylic, Oil and Spray Paint on Fabriano Paper</h4>
          <h4>150cm x 80cm</h4>
          <p>First time I have really explored abstract style. This is a commissioned piece I did for my uncle. I had much time exploring during October trying to figure out what to express. October was a difficult month of frustration and self doubt. I thought the name would be fitting considering the dull and hopeless feeling October felt for me. Throughout this dark storm, there is a sense of calmness and peace that remains within.</p>

          <img src="../portfolio/portfolio-images/Kentality.JPG" width="550" height="380" alt="Digital Artwork">
          <h3>KENTALITY (2023)</h3>
          <h4>Digital Artwork Made with Krita</h4>
          <p>I was fortunate with handling this artwork as an ablum con=ver for my friend. The concept is based on beauty within darkness in which he wanted me to encapsulate the idea of breaking free and expressing yourself within phases of darkness.</p>

          <img src="../portfolio/portfolio-images/Kings Dead.JPG" width="450" height="550" alt="Abstract Painting of a Man">
          <h3>Kings Dead (2021)</h3>
          <h3>Acrylic & Oil on Canvas</h3>
          <h4>30cm x 45cm</h4>
          <p>This piece is based on the civil unrest that happened in July 2021 in Durban. The man with the crown represents former president Jacob Zuma as “the king” who was recognised as a powerful influential political figure for many of those, however, the people were sold false promises and are still unhappy. This piece represents more than just the conflict of that time. It represents the chaos and destruction that this country has suffered and yet more that is yet to come whilst we are still labelled as the rainbow nation. Nothing very colourful in our lives remains.</p>

          <h3>Self Portrait In Three Colours (2023)</h3>
          <h3>Acrylic & Oil on Canvas</h3>
          <h4>100cm x 100cm</h4>
          <p>This is an experiment art piece I did where I was learning about expressing myself using certain colour and how to mix those colours accordingly on the canvas. The title is inspired by Charles Mingus.</p>

        <div class="block">
          <img src="../portfolio/portfolio-images/Sounds of Africa.JPG" width="440" height="550" alt="African Cave Inspired Art">
          <h3>Sounds of Africa (2021)</h3>
          <h3>Acrylic & Oil on Canvas</h3>
          <h4>70cm x 140cm</h4>
          <p>This was a commissioned pieces for a friend of mine who makes music specializing in AfroHouse and AfroTech. He wanted something that resonates with house as a genre and how the sounds express what it means to be African. I spent a lot of time looking at historical African caveman art markings and different patterns of clothing from different South African tribes to understand and try to mix the rhythm of music with art.</p>

          <h3>Acrylic & Watercolour on Canvas</h3>
          <h4>65cm x 95cm</h4>
          <p>A commissioned piece I did for my uncle. The works depict his mother, him and his sisters in their early childhood days. This piece is about family, the feeling of innocence within childhood.</p>
