            <p class="p-summary">In this week's blog post, I will be noting a few changes from my IxD processs. I will alos be discussing and reflecting on my original wireframe designs.</p>
            <div class="e-content">
            
            <h2>Reflection on IxD process</h2>
            <p></p>

            <h2>My Website Plans</h2>
            <p>My goal after having done changes and more planning for my website is to have a very artsy and image stylized website that displays my work and the feeling. I want it to be simple yet easily accessible for users and aesthetically pleasing. Therefore, the feeling that users get just off looking at my homepage should be a feeling that they can feel my personality and my artistic ability before even looking at my portfolio. I want them to feel like they are walking through priceless gallery of my work. With this, I also want to add minimalistic elements of the design into the artwork.</p>
            <p>Aesthetically pleasing, image orientated at times that show some art pieces or animations to feel one with my work and my website. I want to show the user my skillset so they view my website as an artwork, almost like having my work within my work.</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">More IxD Processes and Diagrams will be explained in my <a href="design.html">design page</a></code></p>

            <h2>General Reflection and Goals Forward</h2>
            <p>I can say that I have struggled with more design and structure which has taken up a bit of my time and has not allowed me to fully explore and implement my code as I had planned to but nonetheless, I will complete that this week. Another issue is my user flow and structure. I feel I may have information repetition and cluster.</p>
            <p>I can happily say that I'm proud of the way my wireframes still work according to plan with the colour scheme and minimalistic style. Also, the structure of having the blogs and portfolio information as minimized blocks with images and small description which the user can click to open up and read more is very effective and user friendly and reduces the information cluster.</p>
