            <p class="p-summary">This is weeks blog post will be reflecting on interaction design and my user alignment with my website</p>
            <div class="e-content">
            
            <h2>Interaction Design</h2>
            <p>Interaction Design: Before I get into the details of the slides, I would first like to explain what I think interaction is and what relation it may have to the web. Interaction for me is a form of communication or exchange of information from one platform or person to another. It means that in the form of the web, it involves engagement between people and technology. It can also include communication between individuals in digital spaces like social media. Interaction is important for user experiences and collaboration in different situations.</p>
            <p>When I think of interaction within web design, I think of creating a website that has a layout that compliments its interface. The Interaction Design slideshows discusses how concepts of interaction design and interface design are interlinked. Interaction design focuses on the meeting point between an active body and something that can be affected, such as a user interacting with a website or a game. When I read further, it discusses topics that we learnt in FVPA back in first year such as signs, signifiers and the signified which I think all make sense now in the current context of how it can be applied to web design and interaction. When we look at things like certain web icons or texts, that represents the signifier and with that I began to question how can all three of these be set up in a way that it effectively communicates a good representation of interaction. Furthermore, I also began looking into how it involves responsiveness, non-random behaviour, and requiring non-trivial effort from the user. The interface is the symbolic representation of this interaction and enables and embodies the potential interaction. It is a semiotic system, using signification systems to communicate meaning through signs, such as hyperlinks. The article also covers the process of designing an interface, including alignment, user experience, and interface elements such as input controls and navigational components.</p>

            <h2>My Website Plans</h2>
            <p>For my website, I want it to be mainly art based in terms of my content so the main idea is to create an artistic aesthetic looking website. Therefore, a website that has clear communication within different sections that the user interacts with, allowing the interface and layout to attract different audiences based on the pages they interact with which shall be outlined and detailed below:</p>

            <h2>My User Alignment Goals and How to Articulate Them</h2>
            <p>I want my website to act as a visual and interactive CV and also as a way of displaying who I am to people and what I have to offer. Therefore, it should be as vibrant as my personality. I can do this by different colour combinations that work with different themes. I will also do this by displaying my different portfolio pieces which will be broken down into different sections such as the art pieces I've made and sold, different animations I've made and unity games I've made as well. As much as I want to be vibrant and about me, I will still keep it on a professional but exciting level.</p>
            <p>I want the user to see different sides of me to see my versatility. This will be seen obviously through my portfolio work but also my blog posts, academic essays and other forms of research that I found interesting for the basis of this site. This will also include different skills that I have been learning such as fashion, photography and tattoo designs.</p>
            <p>As I've explained before, I want my website to also act as my C.V. I want it to show, not tell. I will firstly do this adding in various images with explanations of what community projects I've been involved in, job shadowing and work experience and a small “about me” section which will explain my life story and how I got to this stage of my life. I want the user to feel connected with me. This is where the part of them connecting and contacting me comes into place. I want people to be able to contact me for either collaborative projects or enquiring about my work.</p>

            <h2>User and Audience</h2>
            <p>My target audience is quite broad which is why I want to make sure my website effectively attracts all my desired audiences. My target audience is specifically art auctioneer companies, graphic design companies looking for designers specifically banks in the digital marketing department, tattoo parlours, animation studios looking for 2D/3D animators and concept artists, musicians who are seeking a creative director for their music videos and musicians looking for an album cover artist.</p>
            <p>I want them to not only see my work as a C.V. but as an embodiment of my skills and my life. All the work that I have built up and different forms of collaborations to see that my work can be both individual and collaborative skill.</p>
            <p>I want them to be able to interact with my content easily. For example, if I have an animation, I would like to be able to play the animation. Furthermore, be able to engage with my work.</p>

            <h2>Reflection on Exercise</h2>
            <p>IThe exercise above helped me understand more about my URL structure by understanding how to structure my pages for the best accessibility for the user. What I also learnt from this exercise and what I took note from this is that I should also structure each page to have descriptions, then the various content below. It's also important to use semantic markup in the code. This makes it easier for people who have difficulty reading to access the website with aids. Semantic markup is also helpful for coders. If you're collaborating with someone on a website, it's crucial for both of you to understand the code. And even if you revisit the website months later, it's important to be able to understand the code easily.</p>

            <h3>Reflection on my Progress and Further Development:</h3>
            <p>I have not edited my website much but I already have a plan of action for this week. I have planned out different structures and based on my wireframes, I’ve edited a few of them which I plan to implement into my webpage this week. I plan to have my webpage up to date for the upcoming HTML fundamentals assignment. One thing I wish to improve is my submission time for the blog posts as I missed the first and third one. I’ve also decided to try making adjustments in my website code not just for aesthetics but for structure as I don not want too much information overloaded in one page.</p>
