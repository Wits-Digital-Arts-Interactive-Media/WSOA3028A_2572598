            <p class="p-summary">This is my first week's blog post where I will just be outlining the basics of what I want to achieve for my website and the course</p>
            <div class="e-content">
            
            <h2>Reflection on Set-Up Experience</h2>
            <p>I will begin by reflecting my first week and experience with learning the fundamentals of HTML. I wouldn't say it was something difficult but it was something I found interesting. Since I have some experience with GitHub back from 2nd Year Game Design.
                My experience of GitHub from previous assignments and modules has been quite a difficult journey but I have learnt a lot from those past experiences which helped me a lot with this setup. 
                At first, It was very confusing switching between the desktop GitHub and webpage version, however, I finally began to understand how it all links together and most importantly, how the branching system works.</p>
            <p>I found that at the end of the set up, it made a lot of sense as to how to edit and keep track of your webpage.
                Shortly after that, I began exploring and fiddling with GitHub and the code.
                With a person that has no experience of HTML, I understand parts of the code already and the structure of it which may be thanks to learning C# last year but also the use of the readings from last week, beginning with the "World Wide Web".</p>
            <h2>Reflection on Readings</h2>
            <p>The readings gave me different perspectives on the structure of the internet and HTML code. The first reading I'll begin with is the "World Wide Web" reading.
                It talks on how the web is designed as a system to store human knowledge like a pool of information. This reading was very academic and I did find it a bit jarring because there was a bit of information overload especially with the history of W3. 
                Nonetheless, it did help me with understanding the overall structure of HTML as it also spoke about the information being boundless and working as an intricate architecture of information that changes smoothly from one to another.
                What I also found very interesting was how they explained the concept of HTTP and its foundation of it being responsible for efficiently transferring information between web servers and clients.</p>
            <p>The reading that I felt helped me a little more based on the imagery it portrayed for me was "The Library of Babel" by Jorge Luis Borges. 
                This reading was a little more philosophical and used ideas of book shelfs and shape structures which I understood more, guessing because I am good with shapes and images to understand concepts.
                The concept of the library being a space of hexagonal walls that contain shelves made me picture the web as this place of information with different stored sections.
                Something I should consider for the entirety of this course and understanding how great web development can be achieved.</p>
            <h2>Goals For This Course</h2>
            <p>
                As much as I am excited for the aesthetic and creative process, I would also like to learn the structural part.
                Throughout life, I learnt that many skills can be interlinked and collaborated. I want to learn make effective yet different styles of websites that suit what I am trying to do for my art and other creative avenues that I am exploring.
                I want to be able to code and understand my code without hesitation.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    Semantic HTML, or semantic markup, is like giving meaning to a web page through HTML tags instead of just focusing on how it looks. For instance, using a p tag tells both people and browsers that the text inside is a paragraph. It helps in making the content meaningful and structured, not just visually appealing.
