            <h2>Week 1: Module One</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my very first blog post! Here I will be giving insight on the theoretical journey of my Interactive Media course and the build up of my website. I hope you enjoy!</p>

            <h3>Reflection on Set-Up Experience</h3>
            <p>I will begin by reflecting my first week and experience with learning the fundamentals of HTML. I wouldn't say it was something difficult but it was something I found interesting.
                Since I have some experience with GitHub back from 2nd Year Game Design.
                My experience of GitHub from previous assignments and modules has been quite a difficult journey but I have learnt a lot from those past experiences which helped me a lot with this setup. 
                At first, It was very confusing switching between the desktop GitHub and webpage version, however, I finally began to understand how it all links together and most importantly, how the branching system works. 
            </p>

            <p>
                I found that at the end of the set up, it made a lot of sense as to how to edit and keep track of your webpage.
                Shortly after that, I began exploring and fiddling with GitHub and the code.
                With a person that has no experience of HTML, I understand parts of the code already and the structure of it which may be thanks to learning C# last year but also the use of the readings from last week, beginning with the "World Wide Web". 
            </p>

            <h3>Reflection on Readings</h3>
            <p>
                The readings gave me different perspectives on the structure of the internet and HTML code. The first reading I'll begin with is the "World Wide Web" reading.
                It talks on how the web is designed as a system to store human knowledge like a pool of information.
                This reading was very academic and I did find it a bit jarring because there was a bit of information overload especially with the history of W3.
                Nonetheless, it did help me with understanding the overall structure of HTML as it also spoke about the information being boundless and working as an intricate architecture of information that changes smoothly from one to another.
                What I also found very interesting was how they explained the concept of HTTP and its foundation of it being responsible for efficiently transferring information between web servers and clients.
            </p>

            <p>
                The reading that I felt helped me a little more based on the imagery it portrayed for me was "The Library of Babel" by Jorge Luis Borges. 
                This reading was a little more philosophical and used ideas of book shelfs and shape structures which I understood more, guessing because I am good with shapes and images to understand concepts.
                The concept of the library being a space of hexagonal walls that contain shelves made me picture the web as this place of information with different stored sections.
                Something I should consider for the entirety of this course and understanding how great web development can be achieved.
            </p>

            <h3>Goals For This Course</h3>
            <p>
                As much as I am excited for the aesthetic and creative process, I would also like to learn the structural part.
                Throughout life, I learnt that many skills can be interlinked and collaborated. I want to learn make effective yet different styles of websites that suit what I am trying to do for my art and other creative avenues that I am exploring.
                I want to be able to code and understand my code without hesitation.

            <h2>Week 2: Module Two</h2>
            <p>Below is this blog reharding the second week of workign on my website</p>

            <h3>Folder Structure</h3>
            <p>
                At first, I was a bit confused about this section but after the lesson last Thursday, I understood the structure of the pages.
                Based on the idea of how I want my website to look, my folder structure will consist of pages that people can access that open up different parts of the website. 
            </p>

            <h3>Root Folder</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Index.html: This will act as the homepage.
                    The homepage will contain the information about my website and show information about each page that the website contains.
                    It will also offer insight about myself and contain a profile page. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Blog.html: This page will contain all the information about my weekly blog posts and the files.
                    The structure of this folder will contain the blog posts divided into it weeks and I'm potentially thinking of making each week's blog post as a button where the user will click onto it to open and read more.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Portfolio.html: this will contain my information about my artworks and all my portfolio pieces which I will break down from my artworks, to school animation pieces as well as other forms of games I have created.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Design.html: this page will show my design process of my website which will display the wireframe designs and explanations for each page.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Essays.html: this page will display all the essays done for the course and maybe other forms of academic research.
                </li>
                <p style="text-align: center;">Below is an example snippet of my current folder structure</p>
                <img src="images/Folders.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Folder Structure">

                <h3>Url Scheme</h3>
                <p>
                    In this section, I didn't understand it much until after the lecture which also required me to do some research but from what I've also learnt from the reading, I will be using an HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol).
                    This is much easier with it being a basic layout and I want to make sure my web directory is organized. The reason as to why I also chose this is because of transferring information.
                </p>

                <h3>Wireframes and Inspirational Websites</h3>
                <p>My Wireframes and ideas that are inspired from other artistic websites will be inside my design page, you can access it here</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="design.html">Design</a></li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <h3>Reflection on Moulthrop, S (2003) Reading</h3>
            <p>
                I felt like this was a reading that took me a while to understand and grasp key concepts that I could try apply to the design and understanding of my website.
                I felt the part that I actually understood very well was the discussion on hypertext which I could relate with Week 1's blog post regarding The World Wide Web.
                In this reading, Moulthrop discusses the study of hypertext and how it can connect with issues like online censorship, digital privacy etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, he also highlights that user-generated content and participatory culture mirrors discussions on media democratization and citizen journalism in the social media era.
                From this, I noticed he highlighted and emphasized the points of:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The web of today functions as a hypertext system.</li>
                <li>Within the structure of hypertext, we see that instant messaging is a resemblance of hypertext.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Reflection On Interaction and the WWW</h3>
            <p>
                When I think of interaction, I think of the exchange of information between two bodies or systems. So in the context of the WWW, I think of interaction as an input vs output process, a relationship where information is given and as an output process, the response information is the exchanged/received. The lecture, especially the Vox YouTube video, was engaging. Don Norman's anecdote about door design resonated with me, making me rethink everyday objects' usability.
            </p>

            <p>
                Regarding the web, I learned that it's inherently interactive, utilizing computer functions for engagement. Exploring hypertext and hypermedia, I saw parallels with Wikipedia, which resembles modern hypertext. This reinforced my understanding of hypertext's evolution, as Wikipedia's structure mirrors older paper-based hypertexts. Emerging technologies like VR and AI are poised to redefine interaction on the WWW, emphasizing the importance of ongoing dialogue on the ethical and social implications of digital advancements.

            <h2>Week 3: Module 3</h2>

            <h3>Interaction Design</h3>
            <p>
                Interaction Design: Before I get into the details of the slides, I would first like to explain what I think interaction is and what relation it may have to the web. Interaction for me is a form of communication or exchange of information from one platform or person to another. It means that in the form of the web, it involves engagement between people and technology. It can also include communication between individuals in digital spaces like social media. Interaction is important for user experiences and collaboration in different situations.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I think of interaction within web design, I think of creating a website that has a layout that compliments its interface. The Interaction Design slideshows discusses how concepts of interaction design and interface design are interlinked. Interaction design focuses on the meeting point between an active body and something that can be affected, such as a user interacting with a website or a game. When I read further, it discusses topics that we learnt in FVPA back in first year such as signs, signifiers and the signified which I think all make sense now in the current context of how it can be applied to web design and interaction. When we look at things like certain web icons or texts, that represents the signifier and with that I began to question how can all three of these be set up in a way that it effectively communicates a good representation of interaction. Furthermore, I also began looking into how it involves responsiveness, non-random behaviour, and requiring non-trivial effort from the user. The interface is the symbolic representation of this interaction and enables and embodies the potential interaction. It is a semiotic system, using signification systems to communicate meaning through signs, such as hyperlinks. The article also covers the process of designing an interface, including alignment, user experience, and interface elements such as input controls and navigational components.

            <h3>My Website Plans</h3>
            <p>
                For my website, I want it to be mainly art based in terms of my content so the main idea is to create an artistic aesthetic looking website. Therefore, a website that has clear communication within different sections that the user interacts with, allowing the interface and layout to attract different audiences based on the pages they interact with which shall be outlined and detailed below:
            </p>

            <h3>My User Alignment Goals and How to Articulate Them</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>I want my website to act as a visual and interactive CV and also as a way of displaying who I am to people and what I have to offer. Therefore, it should be as vibrant as my personality. I can do this by different colour combinations that work with different themes. I will also do this by displaying my different portfolio pieces which will be broken down into different sections such as the art pieces I've made and sold, different animations I've made and unity games I've made as well. As much as I want to be vibrant and about me, I will still keep it on a professional but exciting level.</li>
                <li>I want the user to see different sides of me to see my versatility. This will be seen obviously through my portfolio work but also my blog posts, academic essays and other forms of research that I found interesting for the basis of this site. This will also include different skills that I have been learning such as fashion, photography and tattoo designs.</li>
                <li>As I've explained before, I want my website to also act as my C.V. I want it to show, not tell. I will firstly do this adding in various images with explanations of what community projects I've been involved in, job shadowing and work experience and a small “about me” section which will explain my life story and how I got to this stage of my life. I want the user to feel connected with me. This is where the part of them connecting and contacting me comes into place. I want people to be able to contact me for either collaborative projects or enquiring about my work.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>User and Audience</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>My target audience is quite broad which is why I want to make sure my website effectively attracts all my desired audiences. My target audience is specifically art auctioneer companies, graphic design companies looking for designers specifically banks in the digital marketing department, tattoo parlours, animation studios looking for 2D/3D animators and concept artists, musicians who are seeking a creative director for their music videos and musicians looking for an album cover artist.</li>
                <li>I want them to not only see my work as a C.V. but as an embodiment of my skills and my life. All the work that I’ve built up and different forms of collaborations to see that my work can be both individual and collaborative skill.</li>
                <li>I want them to be able to interact with my content easily. For example, if I have an animation, I would like to be able to play the animation. Furthermore, be able to engage with my work.</li>
            </ul>

            <img src="images/Me Week 3.png" alt="My User Flow Ideas">

            <h3>Reflection on Exercise</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The exercise above helped me understand more about my URL structure by understanding how to structure my pages for the best accessibility for the user. What I also learnt from this exercise and what I took note from this is that I should also structure each page to have descriptions, then the various content below. It's also important to use semantic markup in the code. This makes it easier for people who have difficulty reading to access the website with aids. Semantic markup is also helpful for coders. If you're collaborating with someone on a website, it's crucial for both of you to understand the code. And even if you revisit the website months later, it's important to be able to understand the code easily.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Reflection on my Progress and Further Development:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>I have not edited my website much but I already have a plan of action for this week. I have planned out different structures and based on my wireframes, I’ve edited a few of them which I plan to implement into my webpage this week. I plan to have my webpage up to date for the upcoming HTML fundamentals assignment. One thing I wish to improve is my submission time for the blog posts as I missed the first and third one. I’ve also decided to try making adjustments in my website code not just for aesthetics but for structure as I don not want too much information overloaded in one page.</li>
            </ul>

            <p style="text-align: center;">11th March 2024</p>
            <h2>Week 4: Module 4</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>My goal after having done changes and more planning for my website is to have a very artsy and image stylized website that displays my work and the feeling. I want it to be simple yet easily accessible for users and aesthetically pleasing. Therefore, the feeling that users get just off looking at my homepage should be a feeling that they can feel my personality and my artistic ability before even looking at my portfolio. I want them to feel like they are walking through priceless gallery of my work. With this, I also want to add minimalistic elements of the design into the artwork.</li>
                <li>Aesthetically pleasing, image orientated at times that show some art pieces or animations to feel one with my work and my website.</li>
                <li>I want to show the user my skillset so they view my website as an artwork, almost like having my work within my work.</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="text-align: center;">More IxD Processes and Diagrams will be explained in my design page</p>

            <h3>General Reflection and Goals Forward</h3>
            <p>I can say that I have struggled with more design and structure which has taken up a bit of my time and has not allowed me to fully explore and implement my code as I had planned to but nonetheless, I will complete that this week. Another issue is my user flow and structure. I feel I may have information repetition and cluster.</p>
            <p>I can happily say that I'm proud of the way my wireframes still work according to plan with the colour scheme and minimalistic style. Also, the structure of having the blogs and portfolio information as minimized blocks with images and small description which the user can click to open up and read more is very effective and user friendly and reduces the information cluster.</p>
