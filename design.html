                <h2>Wireframes</h2>
                <p>This was my first example of a mock design of my homepage wireframe. I prefer very minimalistic and nude colours and structures. I want to focus on having a simple layout that is easily accessible and still attracts the the user keeps them engaged.</p>

                <h1>Home Page Wireframe</h1>
                <p>Here is another wireframe idea of what my homepage layout could possibly look like.</p>
                <img src="images/Homepage Wireframe.jpg" width="900" height="500">

                <h1>Portfolio Page Wireframe</h1>
                <img src="images/Portfolio Wireframe.jpg" width="900" height="500">

                <h1>Blog Page Wireframe</h1>
                <img src="images/Blog Wireframe.jpg" width="900" height="500">

                <h2>Inspirational Websites</h2>
                <p>A lot of the webpage ideas I browsed through were from current artists that I enjoy and I looked at the set up of their page to gain an idea of what mine could look like based of gaining inspiration from some elements of the webpage.</p>
                <img src="images/Inspiration One.jpg" width="900" height="500">
                <ul>
                    <li>This example from June Digan is one that I enjoy a lot. The page seems very filled but not clustered, its placement of images and how they interact with the user make it seem very vibrant. I want the user to interact with the site and feel the vibrancy of my work.</li>
                </ul>
                <img src="images/Inspiration Two.jpg" width="900" height="500">

                <p>Another example which I enjoyed was this website by Jessica Maxwell Bearden. Again, a very simple website that has the image layout in a way that doesn't draw too much away but rather draws you to exploring the site. Not overwhelming and it seems very easy to interact with.</p>
                <img src="images/Jess One.jpg" width="900" height="500">
                <p>Looking below, the same concept of having an image as a cover page is evident</p>

                <h2>Information Structure</h2>
                <img src="images/Info Structure.jpg" width="900" height="500">
                <h2>User Flow</h2>
                <img src="images/User Flow.jpg" width="900" height="500">

                <h2>Interface Elements</h2>
                <h3>Home Page</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The home page will have a background picture like the one used in the example above. There will be a navigation panel at the top with the rest of the pages as buttons.</li>
                    <li>There will be an information section about the website as you scroll down.</li>
                    <li>Although I want my profile page to be the page will my socials, I am thinking of including my socials at the very bottom of the page.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Portfolio</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>This page will contain my portfolio. As the user scrolls down, they can see more sections/folders of different portfolio types.</li>
                    <li>If they click on the various portfolio types it will open up in more detail where they scroll down.</li>
                    <li>I want it laid out in a minimalistic manner, there probably wont be a background image for this.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Profile</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>This will be the section of myself where the user can see my story about myself, my life, my history and most importantly my C.V.</li>
                    <li>The first section will be a picture about me with the story about myself. Then as the user scrolls down there will be more images with various activities that relate to my C.V.</li>
                    <li>They can also click onto different sections of my profile if they wish to read more.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Design</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>This will be the page where the user can scroll and see every design process about the page and my creative process that went through for this page.</li>
                    <li>Like the other page, users can click on each design to view the full design in detail.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Essays</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>his page, the user can scroll down and see the various essays. It will split into minimized section where the user clicks on each essay to expand.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Blogs</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The blog will be split in sections of their date where the user can see a sneak peak of each one with a picture where they will click on the blog they want to read.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Style Guide</h2>
                <p>This is just a rough idea which I will expand but:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I wish to have a very simple and minimalistic font, maybe Calibri. I will be deciding on the font still but the colour will be decided based on the background. I want a nude brown or cream white background. For the page buttons, they will be a bit darker type of brown to contrast with the background.</li>
                    <li>The home page will mostly have an image as a background.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Reflection on Original Wireframes</h2>
                <p>I think a lot has changed more in terms of the layout but I will only be able to see much change once I have fully implemented everything into my code and after learning more CSS and JavaScript.</p>
