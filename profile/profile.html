        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h3>Visual and Multi-Disciplinary Artist</h3>
        <p>Ligudu Mashige (b. 2001, Durban, South Africa. Lives and studies in Johannesburg, South Africa). As a digital arts student, I am mainly focused on the digital creation aspect of art which focuses on game design (both digital and board game), animation and comic book design as well as interactive media and storytelling. However, art is something that I find should not be limited to one field.</p>
        <p>I tend to explore different uses of mediums together to create work that is out of the ordinary. With exploring comes the creation of discoveries. Most of my work utilises oil, acrylic and spray paint on canvases and fabriano paper, mostly creating abstract and cubist figures. Art is not just something you put onto a canvas. It is a way of life and expressing who you are.</p>
        <p>I have thought of it as something that I need to show to the world. Show them who I am and what my mind sees. As a young artist, I am just trying to navigate my thoughts into craft. I have always found it difficult to express things in words, so I just let the colours and brush strokes do the talking. As a creative, I am just trying to explore with others and find innovative ways of integrating art with other art forms like fashion, music etc.</p>
